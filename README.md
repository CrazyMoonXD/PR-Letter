### How much do cross-modal related semantics benefit image captioning by weighting attributes and re-ranking sentences? (Published in Pattern Recognition Letters(2019))
we propose a new method to incorporate the cross-modal related semantics into the encoder-decoder structure
for image captioning. In the encoding stage, we utilize the salient words derived from cross-modal
retrieval to improve the accuracy of attributes. In the decoding stage, we explore two ways to re-rank
the sentences generated through beam search with the guidance of semantics acquired through a
modified cross-modal retrieval method<br>
